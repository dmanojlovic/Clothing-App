# Hello_World_2021

## Our Idea: A clothing profile page (WIP)

### Functions
- Gathers input from users (after every purchase?) regarding how "fitting" the clothing is 
- Scrape from clothing websites, and determine what sizing is appropriate for the user from each store(probably based on the size charts from each store)
- See your friend's profiles and gift functions

### Any potential issues 

### Tasklist 
- Create a basic design of the website 
        - homepage
            - Favourite stores? 
            - 
        - profile page    
        - clothing website page (eg uniqlo, gap etc) (just 1 will do) 
        - friend's page?
- input 
    -
